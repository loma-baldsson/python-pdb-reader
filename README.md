# python-pdb-reader
A (currently unfinished) python interface for the Palm DB format.

## Usage
Since it's unfinished, I'm not going to document anything now. Documentation will come later.

`main.py` and all contents in `test/` are all for testing purposes. 
If you're interested in using the code in this repo, feel free to ignore both of those.
